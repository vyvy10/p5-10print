# p5-10print
The technologies I used to produce this assignment is P5. The languages that I used in this assignments inlcuded HTML, CSS and Eng. I worked with Khan Acadamy, from there I started to learned the "basics" of programming and coding. Which helped me to used to coding. Then I used p5 which is in my opnion is a little bit similar to Khan Acadamy but there are some differences fro example, you can't exactly undo your works. After that I learned how to upload works on to Github. During the process of doing this assignments I used my computer, wifi, the internet for questions or something thta i can't figured out. What I learned through this assignment are the if (random) command, let x=0 which in KhanAcadamy is dfferent. I can also used percentage for programming/coding which I didn't know befroe. There are multiple way to upload images, from easy way to hard way. I learedn that I have to placed the background() under the fuction setup() not function draw().
